              <p>
                Aaron James Judge was born on April 26, 1992, in Linden,
                California. Adopted the day after his birth by Patty and Wayne
                Judge, he grew up in the Central Valley and became a
                multi-sport standout at Linden High School.
              </p>
              <p>
                Judge attended Fresno State University, where he played three
                seasons for the Bulldogs and developed into one of the top
                college prospects in the country. In 2013, the New York Yankees
                selected him in the first round of the MLB Draft with the 32nd
                overall pick.
              </p>
              <p>
                After rising through the Yankees&apos; minor league system, Judge
                made his MLB debut on August 13, 2016, homering in his first
                career at-bat. The rest, as they say, is history.
